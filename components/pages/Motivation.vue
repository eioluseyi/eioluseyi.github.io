                I'm a web developer who's passionate about using code to create beautiful and functional websites.
                <br />
                <br />
                I was hooked on coding from the moment I started learning it in university, and I've been fascinated by CSS
                ever since. I love the way that CSS can be used to transform a plain HTML page into a visually stunning and
                engaging experience.
                <br />
                That's why I closely follow industry leaders like <NuxtLink to="https://twitter.com/kevinjpowell"
                    target="_blank">Kevin Powell</NuxtLink> and <NuxtLink to="https://twitter.com/amit_sheen"
                    target="_blank">Amit Sheen</NuxtLink> to stay ahead of the curve.
                <br />
                <br />
                I've built websites for a variety of clients, ranging from non-profits and small businesses to large scale
                businesses.
                <br />
                I use my coding skills to make websites that are accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical
                knowledge.
                <br />
                <br />
                I believe that web development is a powerful tool that can be used to make a positive impact on the world.
                I'm excited to be a part of this field, and I'm eager to see what the future holds.
                <br />
                <br />
                I also love to teach tech. I've taught children and adults, formally and informally, at the office and
                otherwise.
                I love sharing my knowledge and helping others to learn new things. I believe that everyone has the
                potential to learn to code, and I'm passionate about making that happen.
