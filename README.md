## My portfolio website

Honestly, I can't really pick out what the inspiration for this site was, but I know it's based on a lot of exposure to beautiful UI and a very imaginative mind.

### "Toodles":

- ✅ Horizontal scroll for nav view
- ✅ Experience content
- ✅ Change repo name to eioluseyi.github.io
- ✅ Change project name in package.json
- ✅ Projects content, ⚠️ using github api
- ✅ Contact page
- ⬜️ Mobile responsiveness
- ⬜️ Fix all page preloading due to nav menu (load only current and visited pages and show skeleton for the rest)
- ⬜️ Add nav version for @media (prefers-reduced-motion)
- ⬜️ Clear comments
- ⬜️ Add drop-shadow for nav items in isNavOpen mode
